# Docker Scripts

A collection of scripts for managing docker containers.  These are built for my specific
environment but might be useful for others.

- `backup-container-data.sh` - inspect the docker container for volumes that are bound and 
  backup the data to a mounted directory. Default is /mnt/appdata
